# WindowsDesktopCleaner

This is a python script that "cleans" your desktop by placing all the different file types into there own respective folders. It doesnt do anything with Windows Link Files
or ini (configuration files used by Windows to initialize program settings) files. Which was done on purpose since I want my folder links to still be visible on my desktop.

usage information / how to use:
1. create a folder on your computer and name it "Python_Desktop_Cleaner"
2. within the folder create a python file called "desktop_cleaner.py"
3. navigate to its location via Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
4. once there (assuming python is already installed on your computer), type "python desktop_cleaner.py"
